Note that these are only the spells listed in each book.</br>
Some classes may not have access to all of these spells, and things like Dragon Monsters will have entirely separate versions.</br>
Note also that the level at which these spells are gained may vary from class to class.</br>

Hover over the spell name to see its description. (only for Armageddon presently)</br>
Descriptions listing a range of numerical effects will be based on spell power (usually level-based).</br>
"Bolt or beam" means that the spell has a chance to fire a beam (which hits multiple targets) when your level relative to the spell's is sufficiently high.</br>
"Ball" can be targeted at any point in LOS and fires over enemies. "Rocket" works like a bolt with a radius.</br>
"[xy]" means that the spell multiplies to damage bonuses (such as amulet of the magi) by y.</br></br>
