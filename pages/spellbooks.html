This is a work in progress. The descriptions for each realm are not currently complete.</br>
Note that these are only the spells listed in each book.</br>
Different classes can have different level requirements, sp costs, and failrates for spells. For class-specific info see <a href="spellsbyclass.html">Spells by Class</a>.</br>
This information was taken from wizmode with a Sorcerer for realms Armageddon through Life.</br>

Hover over the spell name to see its description.</br>
Descriptions listing a range of numerical effects will be based on spell power (usually level-based).</br>
"Bolt or beam" means that the spell has a chance to fire a beam (which hits multiple targets) when your level relative to the spell's is sufficiently high.</br>
"Ball" can be targeted at any point in LOS and fires over enemies. "Rocket" works like a bolt with a radius.</br>
"[xy]" means that the spell multiplies to damage bonuses (such as amulet of the magi) by y.</br>
"Trump Summons" means that if the spell fails, the monster(s) who appear(s) will be hostile. There are a few exceptions, however.</br></br>
